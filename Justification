Prim's and Kruskal's 
  -are two algorithms that are used to find the Minimum spanning Tree.
  -Prims is helpful while working with complex graphs with multiple edges. The edges are stored in the queue as we discover each one. 
  -Kruskals are helpful with less complex graphs and controlling the MST as we consider the edges all at once. 
  -THey are recommended for undirected graphs that has positive weights over the edges. 
  -But I have used the algorithms to solve directed grphs with negative weights.
  -They cannot be used to find the shortest path between and the source and every other nodes, as it considers the whole graph to find the 
    path to traverse to every node in the graph with total minimum cost.
  -Considering the Time complexity comparison, Kruskals is a better algorithm than Prim's.

Dijkstra's algorithm on the other hand is used to the minimum distance of every node from source. Is does not focus on producing Spanning tree.
 but this algorithm works well only on directed / undirected graphs with non-negative weights over edges as directed graphs can 
 lead to sudden dead end or can't find minimum paths.
 but,I have tried working with directed graphs with negative weights.
